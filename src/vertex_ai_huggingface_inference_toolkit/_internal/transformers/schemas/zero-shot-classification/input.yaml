    description: >
      The sequence(s) to classify, will be truncated if the model input is too large.
  candidate_labels:
    description: >
      The set of possible class labels to classify each sequence into.
      Can be a single label, a string of comma-separated labels, or a list of labels.

          type: string
  hypothesis_template:
    description: >
      The template used to turn each label into an NLI-style hypothesis.
      This template must include a {} or similar syntax for the candidate label to be inserted into the template.
      The default template is "This example is {}."
    type: string
    default: "This example is {}."
  multi_label:
    description: >
      Whether or not multiple candidate labels can be true.
      If `False`, the scores are normalized such that the sum of the label likelihoods for each sequence is 1.
      If `True`, the labels are considered independent and probabilities are normalized for each candidate by doing a softmax of the entailment score vs. the contradiction score.
    type: boolean
    default: false
